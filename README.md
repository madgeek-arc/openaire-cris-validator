# OpenAIRE CRIS validator

A tool to assess whether an OAI-PMH endpoint can provide research information
complying with the [OpenAIRE Guidelines for CRIS Managers](https://github.com/openaire/guidelines-cris-managers) versions 1.1 and 1.2.
It covers [these checks](CHECKS.md).
Please note that releases before 2.0.0 only support version 1.1 of the Guidelines. 

This is a command-line Java tool that is organized as a [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/) test suite.
You can also run it in your IDE.

Please read below how to [build](#build) it, [run](#run) it, [explore](#internals) its internals and give [feedback](#feedback).
This is Open Source software, available under the terms of the [Apache 2.0 License](#license).


![CI workflow](https://github.com/euroCRIS/openaire-cris-validator/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)
← checking if the software builds and runs on the [example files](./samples).

## Usage

### Build

Please make sure you have checked out the [guidelines-cris-managers](https://github.com/openaire/guidelines-cris-managers) project in a parallel directory.
Then do:

	mvn clean package

We compile for Java 17 by default, but you can switch to 11 or 1.8 [in the POM file](./pom.xml#L16).

### Run

#### From command line

	java -jar target/openaire-cris-validator-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar {endpoint-url}

#### From Eclipse

Set up a JUnit launcher for the `CRISValidator` class.
Pass the OAI-PMH endpoint URL as the value of the system property `endpoint.to.validate`.
Add the parallel `guidelines-cris-managers` project to the classpath of the launcher (in order to access the XML Schemas).

### Checking the examples from OpenAIRE Guidelines for CRIS Managers

Use `file:samples/` as your endpoint-url.

### Diagnostics

The validator copies the responses to the requests it makes into files in the `data/` subdirectory.


## Internals

[CRISValidator](./src/main/java/org/eurocris/openaire/cris/validator/CRISValidator.java) is the main validator class.  It is the JUnit4 test suite. 
As it reads the metadata records from the CRIS:
 * it does simple checks on the fly (using [CheckingIterable](./src/main/java/org/eurocris/openaire/cris/validator/util/CheckingIterable.java)); and
 * it builds an internal representation: a [HashMap](https://devdocs.io/openjdk~17/java.base/java/util/hashmap) of trees that consist of [CERIFNode](./src/main/java/org/eurocris/openaire/cris/validator/tree/CERIFNode.java)s. The last test, `check990_CheckReferentialIntegrityAndFunctionalDependency`, works on this internal representation.

[OAIPMHEndpoint](./src/main/java/org/eurocris/openaire/cris/validator/OAIPMHEndpoint.java) is an independent implementation
of an [OAI-PMH 2.0](https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) client in Java.
While it uses JAXB to map the OAI-PMH 2.0 markup to Java objects, any metadata payload is opaque to it.
For requests that list objects (i.e., `ListIdentifiers`, `ListRecords` or `ListSets`) an [Iterable](https://devdocs.io/openjdk~17/java.base/java/lang/iterable) is returned
that uses the protocol's resumption token mechanism to fetch successive chunks of objects.
This is entirely transparent to the class user. 

If the OAI-PMH 2.0 data provider advertises support for a compression, the endpoint client object will use it.
[CompressionHandlingHttpURLConnectionAdapter](./src/main/java/org/eurocris/openaire/cris/validator/http/CompressionHandlingHttpURLConnectionAdapter.java) is a transparent compression-handling wrapper around an [HttpURLConnection](https://devdocs.io/openjdk~17/java.base/java/net/httpurlconnection).
